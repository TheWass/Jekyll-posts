<p>Welcome!  If you're here, you likely already know who I am. I graduated from Wright State University with a bachelor's degree in computer engineering, and I have been working since.<br />
As such, there are quite a number of things that I have learned in school and at work that I believe would be helpful to others. This site is my chosen medium to pass on such knowledge.  Most of it will likely be tidbits and tricks that I've picked up programming here and there, and I'll be adding more things as time goes on.<br />
Have a poke around. Leave a comment or two.</p>
