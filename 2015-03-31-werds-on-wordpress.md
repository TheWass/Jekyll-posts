<p>My one thought was to get the material that I had already written out on the internet as quickly as possible.  Previously, I had all these posts on a <a href="https://www.drupal.org/" target="_blank">Drupal</a> based web server with limited public access.  I decided to migrate the content to a WordPress-based web server since I have some experience working with WordPress plugins.  WordPress.com provides a hosted web server to easily host and quickly create content.  Hindsight: this may not have been the best decision.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>WordPress.com is a service provided by Automattic which provides a hosted web server for users to quickly stand up a website, create blog material, and post it on the Internet.  The upside of this is it is fast and easy, particularly for non-technical users, to create and share content.  The free version is very basic, and does not include very many customization features.  I gotta pay WordPress.com for the privilege of adding in my own CSS.</p>
<p>WordPress.org on the other hand contains the source code and documentation for the free and open source WordPress framework.  WordPress is actually quite venerable and has been around for a long time.  As with any framework, I have my quarrels with it, but by and large, it is well documented, and fairly simple to extend.</p>
<p>This is the WordPress I want.  Once I get the time, I'll begin migrating the content from werdsofthewass.wordpress.com to some other hosting service.  That way I can leverage the full power of the WordPress framework, and not the limited, suffocated version that WordPress.com offers (at least, for free).</p>
