<p>After doing a good amount of research, I have decided to move Werds of the Wass off of WerdPress.com and to <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub.io</a>.  (BTW, did you know that GitHub can host websites??)  The website will be <a href="https://TheWass.GitHub.io" target="_blank">https://TheWass.GitHub.io</a>.  I'm working on theming  it right now, so there's not much there.</p>
<p>The advantage for having GitHub host the website is updating the website is exactly like committing to GitHub.  Plus, all of my code (and thus, the website) will be versioned.</p>
<p>The disadvantage to GitHub is the server cannot be modified.  It only serves pages; it cannot process PHP, Python, or any other server side code.</p>
<p>Despite the disadvantages, there are tools which can create a very functional website using only non-server code.  <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll </a>is a Ruby program which creates a static site out of markdown content.  <a href="https://disqus.com/websites/" target="_blank">Disqus </a>is a service which provides a space for comments.</p>
<p>Have a GitHub account and want to set up your own?  Go to <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">https://pages.github.com/</a> and follow the instructions.</p>
